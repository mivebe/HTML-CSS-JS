1. Create a basic React.js application using a backend API provided by
API1. All countries
GET
https://excitel-countries.azurewebsites.net/countries
	
API2. Search by name
GET
https://excitel-countries.azurewebsites.net/countries/{name}

search - name of country
e.g. 
https://excitel-countries.azurewebsites.net/countries/z - returns all countries containing in their name the letter z

2. Present in a responsive grid view (table) the results of API1. Provide a filter on name, sorting of columns and paging.

3. Implement details view with the same fields present in the table. Show that details view when the user presses and holds left mouse button over tableâ€™s row for several seconds. Implement some form of small countdown (or progress) indicator so that the user can see how long he should keep pressing until the details view is shown.

4. Implement an autocomplete filter box for the countries using API2 (on each symbol entered in the filter box a suggestions dropdown with up to 10 items is displayed). Prevent multiple requests on each symbol entered (wait until the typing is complete).
When a country is selected show more information about it using the API2 results.

5. Try to architect your solution using best practices - separation of concerns, SOLID principles, DRY etc. 

6. Publish your solution in github and send a link.

Please note that the CORS of the API is intentionally not enabled. You can try to overcome this or contact us to enable the CORS policy for you.
